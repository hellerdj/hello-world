# hello-world
Hey GitHub! 
I'm Danny. I love meeting new people, learning new things (keyboard shortcuts!!), and solving complex problems. I have been developing for just over 8 months and primarily work in PHP, SQL, and Java. Before my eyes were opened to the world of web development, I was in sales. If you ever are looking for networking advice or how to make a cold call, I'd be happy to help you out.
